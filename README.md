# My personal dotfiles

Hey! These are just my personal dotfiles that I am hosting here on GitHub.

Nothing special.

## Installing
This repository is based on a GNU Stow based workflow. 
This means that you just have to use `stow .` inside the repository and the symlinks are set up.

## License
I want to add a license, but I am unsure which license to add at the moment as this is based on many other configuration files.
Even though these configuration files are awesome there is the issue that these licenses are hard to combine.
